<p>WalkerCMS is an open-source, file-driven <abbr title="content-management system">CMS</abbr>.
   No database required.</p>
<h3>No DB?</h3>
<p>That's right, no database required.</p>
<h3>Why no DB?</h3>
<p>WalkerCMS is great for smaller websites that have just a few pages of content; especially where the
   content updates are few and far between. For these minimal requirements, a database would add
   unnecessary complexity. No database also simplifies the process for replicating the production
   environment in the test environment.</p>
