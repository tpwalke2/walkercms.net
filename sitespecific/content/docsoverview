<h3><a name="welcome"></a>Welcome</h3>
<p>Welcome to the WalkerCMS documentation. If this is your first time using WalkerCMS, we recommend
following the links in the sidebar to the left in order.</p>

<h3><a name="audience"></a>Audience</h3>
<p>WalkerCMS is aimed primarily at the small business that needs a simple web presence that serves
up essential, but basic information that rarely changes. Currently, WalkerCMS is built for a
web programmer assisting these small businesses rather than an employee or owner. The idea is to
provide a fairly simple templating engine for content that has little to no dynamic features.</p>

<h3><a name="concepts"></a>Key Concepts</h3>
<p>WalkerCMS is organized such that the website can be either a sibling directory or merged in with
the application core. A website that uses WalkerCMS must configure three separate directories each
with the following functions: public-facing, site configuration, and artifact storage.</p>
<p>A URL for a WalkerCMS-backed website will need to conform to the following (which is already set
   up in the included .htaccess file).</p>
<code>http://your.domain.name/page_id</code>
<p>WalkerCMS uses the <span class="page-id">page_id</span> parameter to determine how and what to
   display to the user. Understandably then, the <span class="page-id">page_id</span> is important
   and is referenced numerous times within this documentation.</p>
<p>Before any further processing, the requested page ID is first compared against the list of
   registered pages. If the page does not exist, then WalkerCMS changes the page ID to
   <span class="page-id">404</span> and the error 404 is displayed.
