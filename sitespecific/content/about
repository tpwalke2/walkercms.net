<h3>History</h3>
<p>WalkerCMS initially started with a homebrew driver. A coworker then pointed me toward the
   <a href="www.codeigniter.com" title="CodeIgniter Framwork">CodeIgniter Framework</a> and I reworked
   the app to use CodeIgniter models, views, and controllers. The downside to both paths was that
   unit-testing was difficult if not impossible.</p>
<p>Later, I stumbled upon the
   <a href="http://laravel.com/" title="Laravel Framework">Laravel Framework</a> and found that unit
   testing was not only possible, but easy. So, WalkerCMS has been reworked for Laravel (currently 3.2.12).</p>
