<h3><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h3>
<p>WalkerCMS provides additional features outside of its primary purpose of page
   generation. Other parts of the documentation may refer to these features, but the idea
   here is to explain the purpose and usage of each one.</p>

<h3><a name="contact-form"></a>Contact Form</h3>
<p>WalkerCMS provides a basic contact form that allows users to submit questions or begin
   conversations with the website owner. The form submits data to a PHP script on the
   server that then proceses it and sends an email to the site owner and website admin.</p>
<p>After your website is set up, there are two steps to enabling the contact form:
   configuration and placement (explained in detail further below).</p>
<p>
  There are a few features wrapped into the contact form with which you should be familiar.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Client-side validation of name, email, and message<sup>*</sup></li>
  <li>Server-side fallback validation of name, email, and message</li>
  <li>Client-side spam prevention<sup>*</sup></li>
  <li>Server-side fallback spam validation</li>
  <li>AJAX form submission and results display (no page refresh)<sup>*</sup></li>
  <li>Server-side fallback to form processing</li>
</ul>
<p>* - requires scripting to be enabled on the users computer.</p>
<h4 id="contact-form-configuration">Configuration</h4>
<p>Configuring the contact form requires setting a few different settings in the
   site configuration file:</p>
<ul class="setting-name">
  <li>admin_email</li>
  <li>admin_name</li>
  <li>contact_email</li>
  <li>contact_name</li>
  <li>contact_page</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="#site-config" title="Site Configuration">Site Configuration</a> for more
   details.</p>
<p class="back-to-top"><a href="#top" title="Back to top">Back to top</a></p>

<h4 id="contact-form-placement">Placement</h4>
<p>After you configure the contact form, you must specify where the contact form will go
   in your overall layout. You do this by adding the following snippet to the content file
   for the page ID you specified as the <span class="setting-name">contact_page</span>
   in the site configuration setting:</p>
<code>&lt;?php $contact_form ?&gt;</code>
<p>This will not only indicate the placement of the form, but also the placement of the
   submission results - success, failure, or validation error.</p>

<h3><a name="ie-warning"></a>Internet Explorer&reg; Warning</h3>
<p>Most users do not upgrade the web browser that comes with their computer. As such, there
   are a number of users out there with IE7 or earlier. This feature allows you to configure
   a message to be displayed to those users to encourage them to upgrade their browser. There
   are two settings for configuring this feature:</p>
<ul class="setting-name">
  <li>maximum_unsupported_ie_version</li>
  <li>show_ie_warning</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature is on by default and set to show warnings for versions 7 and below. You
   can read more about why this feature is necessary for
   <a href="http://www.ie6nomore.com/" title="No more IE6" target="_blank">IE6</a> and
   <a href="http://theie7countdown.com/" title="No more IE7" target="_blank">IE7</a>.</p>
<p>The presence of this feature does not imply a dislike towards Internet Explorer&reg; in
   general. It is just that IE6 and IE7 have been the cause of numerous headaches when
   attempting to use more advanced styling and scripting.</p>
